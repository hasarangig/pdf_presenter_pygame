This folder can contain any extra documentation that is not covered in the
project's README file.

An elegant use for this folder is to help one de-clutter source code files from
the kind of long, 'user-oriented' docstrings that would otherwise need to appear
at the top of each file; this can be done by placing the relevant docstrings
here as separate textfiles, and accessing their contents via their respective
modules' `__doc__` attributes as necessary.

This allows the programmer to keep the opening of their source code files clean
from distracting user-intended docstrings, and focused on more
'implementation-relevant' comments and documentation, without sacrificing a
user's ability to look-up relevant user-documentation during an interactive
python session.

Recommended filenames for such docstring textfiles are packagename.__doc__ for
the package itself and packagename.src.modulename.__doc__ for all others, such
that the names reflect the respective modules to which they refer.
                                                                    
An example packagename.__doc__ is provided here; note how this is used from
within the package's __init__.py file.
